Hear Way Sight

An accessible-first weather application built with Angular 16, designed to provide clear and usable weather information for everyone, including users of assistive technologies. This application fetches data from WeatherAPI.com.

Project Description

The primary goal of Accessible Weather Shelter is to ensure blind and visually impaired individuals can independently and safely find, navigate, and use emergency weather shelters. It provides critical, accessible, non-visual guidance and information during severe weather events.

Many standard weather and emergency applications rely on purely visual cues (like interactive maps, colors, and icons) that create significant barriers for users with visual impairments. This project addresses that critical gap.


Features

Current Weather: Get real-time weather conditions for any city,location.

Weather Forecast: View a multi-day forecast.

Integrated Text-to-Speech (TTS): This feature uses the SpeechSynthesis API to read alerts and shelter details aloud only when the user requests.

Dual API Support: Includes services for both OpenWeather and WeatherAPI.com.

Responsive Design: Usable on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Accessibility-First: Built from the ground up with accessibility in mind.
